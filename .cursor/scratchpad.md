# Zora Creator Earnings Analytics Miniapp

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a miniapp that displays analytics about creator earnings across coins on Zora. This will help creators track their earnings, understand their collector base, and visualize performance over time.

Key features include:
- Total earnings from posts
- Average earnings per post / timeframe
- Number of collectors (buy and hold)
- Number of traders (buy and sell)
- Charts showing performance over time

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Accessing Zora's API to fetch creator earnings data
   - The existing codebase already integrates with Zora's API using the @zoralabs/coins-sdk
   - Current implementation fetches profile and token balances, but needs to be extended to fetch creator earnings data
   - Research findings:
     - Zora SDK provides several methods for querying coin and profile data
     - For creator earnings, we can use `getProfile` and `getProfileBalances` from the coins-sdk
     - For historical data on trades, we'll need to track the coin activity over time
     - We can use the protocol rewards tracking for creator fees
     - No direct "earnings analytics" endpoint exists, so we'll need to calculate metrics from transaction data

2. Structuring and processing the data for different analytics metrics
   - Need to calculate total earnings across all tokens
   - Need to track earnings over time to calculate averages and trends
   - Need to classify users as collectors vs. traders based on transaction history
   - Research findings:
     - We can use the `getCoin` function to get details about each coin including total volume, price data
     - Trading activity can be tracked through the transaction history
     - We'll need to implement custom logic to classify users as traders or collectors based on their buy/sell behavior

3. Building interactive and responsive charts for data visualization
   - Need to select and integrate a charting library compatible with Next.js
   - Design responsive chart layouts for mobile-first UI
   - Implement filters for different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Research findings:
     - Several chart libraries work well with Next.js: Chart.js, Recharts, or Visx
     - For responsive design, we can leverage the existing MiniKit UI components
   - Implementation decision:
     - Selected Recharts as our charting library for its React integration and performance

4. Creating a user-friendly interface for viewing analytics
   - Extend the existing MiniKit UI components for analytics displays
   - Create dashboard layouts with cards for different metrics
   - Ensure accessibility and responsiveness
   - Research findings:
     - The existing codebase has a component called ZoraWalletInput.tsx that we can extend
     - We can build on top of the current UI structure with additional views for analytics

5. Implementing authentication for accessing personal creator data
   - Ensure that only the creator can access their earnings data
   - Leverage existing Farcaster authentication in MiniKit
   - Research findings:
     - MiniKit already provides authentication via Farcaster
     - We can use the existing context.user data to verify the user's identity

6. Creating a shareable analytics card with social media integration
   - Need to design a compact card view that summarizes key analytics
   - Need to integrate with Twitter and Warpcast for social sharing
   - Need to implement image download functionality
   - Research findings:
     - Can leverage the existing html-to-image library for creating downloadable images
     - Can extend the existing ShareButton component to support multiple platforms
     - Need to create a dedicated endpoint for generating optimized sharing images

# Zora Creator Earnings Analytics Miniapp

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a miniapp that displays analytics about creator earnings across coins on Zora. This will help creators track their earnings, understand their collector base, and visualize performance over time.

Key features include:
- Total earnings from posts
- Average earnings per post / timeframe
- Number of collectors (buy and hold)
- Number of traders (buy and sell)
- Charts showing performance over time

The application has been successfully implemented with a focus on performance optimization, especially for users with many coins.

A new feature has been added to enable premium content, allowing creators to receive $1 USDC payments via Warpcast wallet. However, there's currently an issue with the wallet detection that needs to be fixed.

- [ ] **CURRENT TASK: Fix InvalidSignature() error in spend permission flow**

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Current Issue: InvalidSignature() Error Resolution**
- **Status**: IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING
- **Root Cause**: The signature was being generated by the user's wallet but the transaction was being executed by the spender's wallet (backend), causing signature validation to fail
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Modified backend to return transaction data instead of executing the transaction
  - Updated frontend to execute the `approveWithSignature` transaction from the user's wallet
  - Fixed type definitions and imports for proper Wagmi integration

**Technical Changes Made**:
1. **Backend (app/api/spend-permission/approve/route.ts)**:
   - Removed spender wallet execution logic
   - Added `encodeFunctionData` to prepare transaction data
   - Returns transaction data for frontend execution instead of executing directly

2. **Frontend (components/spend-permissions/SpendPermissionCollage.tsx)**:
   - Added proper imports for `spendPermissionManagerAbi`
   - Updated `handleGenerateCollage` to execute transaction from user's wallet
   - Fixed type definitions for `spendPermission` state
   - Added transaction confirmation waiting logic

3. **Providers (app/providers.tsx)**:
   - Exported the Wagmi config for use in other components

**Expected Behavior**:
- User signs the spend permission message
- Backend prepares the transaction data
- Frontend executes the transaction from user's wallet
- Transaction should succeed since signature matches the executor
- Collage generation proceeds after successful approval

**Testing Required**:
- User needs to test the spend permission flow
- Verify transaction execution from user's wallet
- Confirm collage generation works after approval

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- When working with blockchain transactions, use the correct contract addresses for the target network
- When implementing wallet integrations, check the specific wallet's documentation for the proper connection method
- For Warpcast wallet integration, we need to use MiniKit's context for user authentication and carefully check for the wallet environment
- **BigInt Serialization Issue Resolution**: When working with BigInt values in JavaScript/TypeScript, they cannot be directly serialized with JSON.stringify(). The solution is to:
  1. Convert BigInt values to strings before creating the object for serialization
  2. Remove unnecessary BigInt serializer functions from JSON.stringify() calls
  3. Ensure the backend properly converts string values back to BigInt/numbers when needed
  4. Avoid creating BigInt values in the first place if they can be handled as strings or numbers
- **InvalidSignature() Error Resolution**: When implementing spend permissions, the user must execute the `approveWithSignature` transaction from their own wallet, not from the spender's wallet. The correct flow is:
  1. User signs the spend permission message
  2. Backend validates and prepares transaction data
  3. Frontend executes the transaction using the user's wallet
  4. This ensures the signature matches the transaction executor
